;;;;;; paredit: Parenthesis editing minor mode
;;;;;; Version 16

;;; This code is written by Taylor Campbell (except where explicitly
;;; noted) and placed in the Public Domain.  All warranties are
;;; disclaimed.

;;; Add this to your .emacs after adding paredit.el to /path/to/elisp/:
;;;
;;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/elisp/")
;;;   (autoload 'enable-paredit-mode "paredit"
;;;     "Turns on pseudo-structural editing of Lisp code."
;;;     t)
;;;   (add-hook '...-mode-hook 'enable-paredit-mode)
;;;
;;; Usually the ... will be lisp or scheme or both.  Alternatively, you
;;; can manually turn on this mode with M-x enable-paredit-mode and
;;; turn it off with M-x disable-paredit-mode.
;;;
;;; This is written for GNU Emacs.  It is known not to work in XEmacs.
;;; The author wrote it with GNU Emacs 22.0.50; it may work in
;;; slightly earlier versions, but not older than 21 or so.  An
;;; alternative minor mode, PAREDIT-TERMINAL-MODE, is provided that
;;; works in Emacs under Unix terminals (i.e. `emacs -nw').
;;;
;;; This mode changes the keybindings for a number of simple keys,
;;; notably (, ), ", \, and ;.  The round bracket keys are defined to
;;; insert parenthesis pairs and move past the close, respectively;
;;; the double-quote key is multiplexed to do both, and also insert an
;;; escape if within a string; backslashes prompt the user for the
;;; next character to input, because a lone backslash can break
;;; structure inadvertently; and semicolons ensure that they do not
;;; accidentally comment valid structure.  (Use M-; to comment an
;;; expression.)  These all have their ordinary behaviour when inside
;;; comments, and, outside comments, if truly necessary, you can insert
;;; them literally with C-q.
;;;
;;; It also changes several standard editing keybindings including
;;; RET, C-j, C-d, DEL, & C-k.  RET & C-j are transposed from their
;;; usual paired meaning, where RET inserts a newline and C-j fancily
;;; adds a new line with indentation &c., but I find the transposition
;;; more convenient.  (You are free to change this, of course.)  C-d,
;;; DEL, & C-k are instrumented to respect the S-expression structure.
;;; You can, however, pass a prefix argument to them to get their
;;; usual behaviour if necessary; e.g., C-u C-k will kill the whole
;;; line, regardless of what S-expression structure there is on it.
;;;
;;; Automatic reindentation is performed as locally as possible, to
;;; ensure that Emacs does not interfere with custom indentation used
;;; elsewhere in some S-expression.  It is performed only by the
;;; advanced S-expression frobnication commands, and only on the forms
;;; that were immediately operated upon (& their subforms).
;;;
;;; This code is written for clarity, not efficiency.  S-expressions
;;; are frequently walked over redundantly.  If you have problems with
;;; some of the commands taking too long to execute, tell me, but first
;;; make sure that what you're doing is reasonable: it is stylistically
;;; bad to have huge, long, hideously nested code anyway.
;;;
;;; Questions, bug reports, comments, feature suggestions, &c., can be
;;; addressed to the author via mail on the host mumble.net to campbell
;;; or via IRC on irc.freenode.net in #emacs, #scheme, or #lisp, under
;;; the nick Riastradh.

;;; This assumes Unix-style LF line endings.
